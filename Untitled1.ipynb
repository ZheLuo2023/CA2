      "{\"author\": \"shorelined\", \"body\": \"I use public transport quite a lot and it doesn't tend to let me down too much. I think if you are prepared to do a bit of research and adjust your plans then you can have an okay experience, but really we shouldn't be at a point where that has to happen. The government and transport companies look at passenger numbers and think it is as high as can be be, rather than realising that there's a ton of people out there who would use it if they didn't have to wait two hours between services. The same problem is the reason they don't replace connections through the capital with direct services: sure people don't go from Cork to Sligo now, so why bother? It's this attitude that needs to change at all levels of power, otherwise we will be three decades down the road and Dublin will still dominate the country with all the current issues that it brings. Getting any form of public transport between cities is always going to be cheaper than the car, but the car drops you at your house not in a windswept station with no facilities and relying on a connecting service to finish your journey.\\n\\nIrish Rail is very cheap compared to the UK, the problem is simply one of capacity and frequency. Things like staff, engine and driver numbers will always impose an upper ceiling on things but Irish Rail doesn't seem prepared to ramp up train numbers to bring in any latent demand. They think that the 9pm train being quiet is a reason not to put on an 11pm one, rather than realising that people are simply driving because there's no other option.\\n\\nThe intercity coaches are a good fallback if you need to get somewhere later at night, but my experience of these is solely travelling between Dublin and another city. You might get lucky if you happen to be on the end of a spur, so Limerick to Ennis or Cork to Tralee, or somewhere on the way, like Kildare village, but outside of that you are screwed. That said, I find the intercities are reliable and cheap, but as somebody else said, interacting with the driver on a basic question can drastically change your opinion. I don't know if it's because some services are government-run or because there is a driver shortage and they can get away with it, but the way some speak to passengers who are being polite and asking sensible questions is shocking. I totally understand that there are plenty of arsehole passengers too, but I actually see less of those compared to drivers kicking off.\\n\\nIn the cities the bus problem for me is that they simply don't run late enough, and then you are in the hands of taxi drivers who are openly turning meters off because they are never inspected. Same problem with the Luas and the Dart, which only cover a minority of the city anyway. Again I find the fares cheap, it's like 1.35 or something in Limerick, but I can imagine having to connect between services is no craic. Also I find the bus drivers seem to be much less unhinged than the coach drivers, although I figured they'd have much more reason to hate every passenger they see.\\n\\nFor my pipe dream, I'd have every city north and south connected by a direct service, as well as every university, port and airport. I'd have most of the arterial carriageways and all circular routes in Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Limerick, Derry and Galway have a tramline in the bus lane. Dublin has already re-designed the bus network based on this system. Any major European city, and most of the smaller ones, have this system. Lisbon had a massive tram network right across the oldest parts of town where routes wind around tiny hillside streets, the particular trams are smaller in those parts but even Porto, Prague, Cologne, Milan and Stockholm all have this. I've never used the rental bikes and scooters as I have my own and live in a small city, but I see plenty of young people and loads of tourists using them, probably a good alternative to ramming a bike into a one-bedroom apartment. I'd also personally collect and bury every single Leap card at the bottom of the sea and replace it with a contactless system that is seamless between services, meaning you get off a bus and onto a bike within 90 minutes and it is a single charge. \\n\\nWe have to be serious about climate change but even if you don't give a shit about that, these are all things that exist in plenty of other places that we like to group ourselves into, and plenty of others we don't. For a small country with no major environmental challenges of freak weather events to contend with, as well as a massive budget surplus to spend, we should have a significant headstart on most other places, but we're crippled by parochialism, short-termism and a lack of strategic thinking. There's finally work being done on a rail link between Limerick and Foynes, and it only seemed to get over the line because they don't want rich Americans stuck in traffic for the Ryder Cup. The operator at Foynes and the EU was pleading with the government to re-open the line, and when they finally decided to, they forgot to survey the part of the line that goes to the cement factory. We're talking 2 or 3km of track that could take major freight traffic off the road, but as usual everyone thought it was somebody else's problem.\", \"created_utc\": 1700557255.0}\n",

      "{\"author\": \"Jamiegrr\", \"body\": \"I would highly advise against using public transport in Ireland for a number of reasons.\\n\\n\\n**1. Expensive**\\nIn comparison to other EU countries, it's ridiculously expensive. The train costs \\u20ac22.50 to get from Dublin to Westport (probably more now) - in comparison, in France, you can travel a similar distance near Montpellier for \\u20ac1. Buses here are also crazy expensive compared to the rest of Europe. It costs more to travel from Shannon Airport to Galway than it does to take a flight from Spain to Ireland.\\n\\n\\n**2. Lack of Quality**\\nI took a bus two weeks ago, there was one empty row at the back, when I got there, the entire seat was broken and pulled away from the back. You'll find the depths in the windows covered in years of dirt, not to mention the smell of shite. The same goes for trains. You'll have a sore arse after an hour journey.\\n\\n**3. No Country for Students**\\nThe NTA (The Irish body for national transport) recently banned all student cards for travelling, allowing only a special paid card which cannot be availed of by any student outside of Ireland (and many within Ireland, because lots of universities have recently changed their name and the system hasn't updated it). It's a 100% reduction. Ireland is the only country I've come across, which doesn't offer a student discount for international visitors.\\n\\n\\n**4. Loud Passengers**\\nPublic transport in Ireland is unique in comparison to the rest of Europe, in that loud noise is generally accepted. One of the biggest changes for me living in another country coming from Ireland is how quiet public transport (in particular trains) was.\\n\\n\\n**5. Never on Time**\\nPublic transport in Ireland is never on time, I have literally never taken a bus or train that arrived and departed on the time it was meant to. Generally, it's 20 minutes on either side of the expected time. Drivers don't give a shite, I was once on a bus which was an hour late and the driver got off to get a takeaway halfway through the journey.\", \"created_utc\": 1700349368.0}\n",

I don\\u2019t know if it would help but on the assumption that most tourists using public transport travel from Dublin to Galway and Galway to the Cliffs/ Doolin, the bus route then continues to Ennis from the Cliffs so (I\\u2019m theorising here now, don\\u2019t know for sure if this is true) possibly the bus may be less busy going south from the Cliffs to Ennis. \\n\\nSo an option might be to get train (slightly less convenient than the Galway train) to Ennis and buck the trend by getting the bus North, and on your return head south to Ennis unfortunately you\\u2019ll miss the Burren which is on the bus journey north from Doolin to Galway and very memorable scenery in my view.  Another possible option would be Dublin Galway (train) Doolin/Cliffs by bus, bus to Ennis and train back to Dublin from Ennis which at least avoids the risk that say the bus to Galway in Doolin has already filled up at the Cliffs. That route through Ennis would set you up well to head to Killarney or Cork if that was part of your itinerary.\\n\\nAs I say you\\u2019d need to get someone with personal experience to confirm this. You could always ring Ennis or Galway Bus station for advice as well.\", \"created_utc\": 1700400008.0}\n",
